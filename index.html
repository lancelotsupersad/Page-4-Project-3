    <p class="projectoverview" style="font-size: 20px;">
    I was the website designer for a group of students working on a project called Spark. This project aimed to create an AI-generated pickup line based on a screenshot of a text conversation. All of my work done for this team was intended to be pro bono, meaning it was for free and to gain experience for myself. Due to my inexperience, I didn’t understand how to approach a pro bono work approach and did not set clear deadlines, expectations, or the amount of hours I was willing to work on the project. This resulted in unfair deadlines, workload, and expectations.
